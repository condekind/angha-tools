GObject compatibility loader; supports ``gi`` and ``pgi``.

The binding selection rules are as follows:
- if ``gi`` has already been imported, use it; else
- if ``pgi`` has already been imported, use it; else
- if ``gi`` can be imported, use it; else
- if ``pgi`` can be imported, use it; else
- error out.

Thus, to force usage of PGI when both bindings are installed, import it first.
