        Versatile (private) method defined for all TriInterpolators.

        :meth:`_interpolate_multikeys` is a wrapper around method
        :meth:`_interpolate_single_key` (to be defined in the child
        subclasses).
        :meth:`_interpolate_single_key actually performs the interpolation,
        but only for 1-dimensional inputs and at valid locations (inside
        unmasked triangles of the triangulation).

        The purpose of :meth:`_interpolate_multikeys` is to implement the
        following common tasks needed in all subclasses implementations:

            - calculation of containing triangles
            - dealing with more than one interpolation request at the same
              location (e.g., if the 2 derivatives are requested, it is
              unnecessary to compute the containing triangles twice)
            - scaling according to self._unit_x, self._unit_y
            - dealing with points outside of the grid (with fill value np.nan)
            - dealing with multi-dimensionnal *x*, *y* arrays: flattening for
              :meth:`_interpolate_params` call and final reshaping.

        (Note that np.vectorize could do most of those things very well for
        you, but it does it by function evaluations over successive tuples of
        the input arrays. Therefore, this tends to be more time consuming than
        using optimized numpy functions - e.g., np.dot - which can be used
        easily on the flattened inputs, in the child-subclass methods
        :meth:`_interpolate_single_key`.)

        It is guaranteed that the calls to :meth:`_interpolate_single_key`
        will be done with flattened (1-d) array_like input parameters `x`, `y`
        and with flattened, valid `tri_index` arrays (no -1 index allowed).

        Parameters
        ----------
        x, y : array_like
            x and y coordinates indicating where interpolated values are
            requested.
        tri_index : integer array_like, optional
            Array of the containing triangle indices, same shape as
            *x* and *y*. Defaults to None. If None, these indices
            will be computed by a TriFinder instance.
            (Note: For point outside the grid, tri_index[ipt] shall be -1).
        return_keys : tuple of keys from {'z', 'dzdx', 'dzdy'}
            Defines the interpolation arrays to return, and in which order.

        Returns
        -------

class LinearTriInterpolator(TriInterpolator):

class CubicTriInterpolator(TriInterpolator):
    """
    A CubicTriInterpolator performs cubic interpolation on triangular grids.

    In one-dimension - on a segment - a cubic interpolating function is
    defined by the values of the function and its derivative at both ends.
    This is almost the same in 2-d inside a triangle, except that the values
    of the function and its 2 derivatives have to be defined at each triangle
    node.

    The CubicTriInterpolator takes the value of the function at each node -
    provided by the user - and internally computes the value of the
    derivatives, resulting in a smooth interpolation.
    (As a special feature, the user can also impose the value of the
    derivatives at each node, but this is not supposed to be the common
    usage.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    triangulation : :class:`~matplotlib.tri.Triangulation` object
        The triangulation to interpolate over.
    z : array_like of shape (npoints,)
        Array of values, defined at grid points, to interpolate between.
    kind : {'min_E', 'geom', 'user'}, optional
        Choice of the smoothing algorithm, in order to compute
        the interpolant derivatives (defaults to 'min_E'):

            - if 'min_E': (default) The derivatives at each node is computed
              to minimize a bending energy.
            - if 'geom': The derivatives at each node is computed as a
              weighted average of relevant triangle normals. To be used for
              speed optimization (large grids).
            - if 'user': The user provides the argument `dz`, no computation
              is hence needed.

    trifinder : :class:`~matplotlib.tri.TriFinder` object, optional
        If not specified, the Triangulation's default TriFinder will
        be used by calling
        :func:`matplotlib.tri.Triangulation.get_trifinder`.
    dz : tuple of array_likes (dzdx, dzdy), optional
        Used only if  *kind* ='user'. In this case *dz* must be provided as
        (dzdx, dzdy) where dzdx, dzdy are arrays of the same shape as *z* and
        are the interpolant first derivatives at the *triangulation* points.

    Methods
    -------
    `__call__` (x, y) :  Returns interpolated values at x,y points
    `gradient` (x, y) : Returns interpolated derivatives at x,y points

    Notes
    -----
    This note is a bit technical and details the way a
    :class:`~matplotlib.tri.CubicTriInterpolator` computes a cubic
    interpolation.

    The interpolation is based on a Clough-Tocher subdivision scheme of
    the *triangulation* mesh (to make it clearer, each triangle of the
    grid will be divided in 3 child-triangles, and on each child triangle
    the interpolated function is a cubic polynomial of the 2 coordinates).
    This technique originates from FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis;
    the element used is a reduced Hsieh-Clough-Tocher (HCT)
    element. Its shape functions are described in [1]_.
    The assembled function is guaranteed to be C1-smooth, i.e. it is
    continuous and its first derivatives are also continuous (this
    is easy to show inside the triangles but is also true when crossing the
    edges).

    In the default case (*kind* ='min_E'), the interpolant minimizes a
    curvature energy on the functional space generated by the HCT element
    shape functions - with imposed values but arbitrary derivatives at each
    node. The minimized functional is the integral of the so-called total
    curvature (implementation based on an algorithm from [2]_ - PCG sparse
    solver):

        .. math::

            E(z) = \\ \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega}   \\left(
            \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2{z}}{\\partial{x}^2} \\right)^2 +
            \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2{z}}{\\partial{y}^2} \\right)^2 +
            2\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2{z}}{\\partial{y}\\partial{x}}
            \\right)^2 \\right)  dx\\,dy

    If the case *kind* ='geom' is chosen by the user, a simple geometric
    approximation is used (weighted average of the triangle normal
    vectors), which could improve speed on very large grids.
