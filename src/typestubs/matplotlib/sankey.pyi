    Sankey diagram in matplotlib

      Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which
      the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow
      quantity.  They are typically used to visualize energy or
      material or cost transfers between processes.

          ===============   ===================================================
          Field             Description
          ===============   ===================================================
          *ax*              axes onto which the data should be plotted
                            If *ax* isn't provided, new axes will be created.
          *scale*           scaling factor for the flows
                            *scale* sizes the width of the paths in order to
                            maintain proper layout.  The same scale is applied
                            to all subdiagrams.  The value should be chosen
                            such that the product of the scale and the sum of
                            the inputs is approximately 1.0 (and the product of
                            the scale and the sum of the outputs is
                            approximately -1.0).
          *unit*            string representing the physical unit associated
                            with the flow quantities
                            If *unit* is None, then none of the quantities are
                            labeled.
          *format*          a Python number formatting string to be used in
                            labeling the flow as a quantity (i.e., a number
                            times a unit, where the unit is given)
          *gap*             space between paths that break in/break away
                            to/from the top or bottom
          *radius*          inner radius of the vertical paths
          *shoulder*        size of the shoulders of output arrowS
          *offset*          text offset (from the dip or tip of the arrow)
          *head_angle*      angle of the arrow heads (and negative of the angle
                            of the tails) [deg]
          *margin*          minimum space between Sankey outlines and the edge
                            of the plot area
          *tolerance*       acceptable maximum of the magnitude of the sum of
                            flows
                            The magnitude of the sum of connected flows cannot
                            be greater than *tolerance*.
          ===============   ===================================================

        The optional arguments listed above are applied to all subdiagrams so
        that there is consistent alignment and formatting.

        If :class:`Sankey` is instantiated with any keyword arguments other
        than those explicitly listed above (``**kwargs``), they will be passed
        to :meth:`add`, which will create the first subdiagram.

        In order to draw a complex Sankey diagram, create an instance of
        :class:`Sankey` by calling it without any kwargs::

            sankey = Sankey()

        Then add simple Sankey sub-diagrams::

            sankey.add() # 1
            sankey.add() # 2
            #...
            sankey.add() # n

        Finally, create the full diagram::

            sankey.finish()

        Or, instead, simply daisy-chain those calls::

            Sankey().add().add...  .add().finish()

        .. seealso::

          *orientations*    list of orientations of the paths
                            Valid values are 1 (from/to the top), 0 (from/to
                            the left or right), or -1 (from/to the bottom).  If
                            *orientations* == 0, inputs will break in from the
                            left and outputs will break away to the right.
          *labels*          list of specifications of the labels for the flows
                            Each value may be *None* (no labels), '' (just
                            label the quantities), or a labeling string.  If a
                            single value is provided, it will be applied to all
                            flows.  If an entry is a non-empty string, then the
                            quantity for the corresponding flow will be shown
                            below the string.  However, if the *unit* of the
                            main diagram is None, then quantities are never
                            shown, regardless of the value of this argument.
          *trunklength*     length between the bases of the input and output
                            groups
          *pathlengths*     list of lengths of the arrows before break-in or
                            after break-away
                            If a single value is given, then it will be applied
                            to the first (inside) paths on the top and bottom,
                            and the length of all other arrows will be
                            justified accordingly.  The *pathlengths* are not
                            applied to the horizontal inputs and outputs.
          *prior*           index of the prior diagram to which this diagram
                            should be connected
          *connect*         a (prior, this) tuple indexing the flow of the
                            prior diagram and the flow of this diagram which
                            should be connected
                            If this is the first diagram or *prior* is *None*,
                            *connect* will be ignored.
          *rotation*        angle of rotation of the diagram [deg]
                            *rotation* is ignored if this diagram is connected
                            to an existing one (using *prior* and *connect*).
                            The interpretation of the *orientations* argument
                            will be rotated accordingly (e.g., if *rotation*
                            == 90, an *orientations* entry of 1 means to/from
                            the left).
          ===============   ===================================================

        Valid kwargs are :meth:`matplotlib.patches.PathPatch` arguments:

        %(Patch)s

        As examples, ``fill=False`` and ``label='A legend entry'``.
        By default, ``facecolor='#bfd1d4'`` (light blue) and
        ``linewidth=0.5``.

        The indexing parameters (*prior* and *connect*) are zero-based.

        The flows are placed along the top of the diagram from the inside out
        in order of their index within the *flows* list or array.  They are
        placed along the sides of the diagram from the top down and along the
        bottom from the outside in.

        If the sum of the inputs and outputs is nonzero, the discrepancy
        will appear as a cubic Bezier curve along the top and bottom edges of
        the trunk.
